1. Initial placment of mines did not result in the correct number being placed. The necessary solution was to use a while loop to check against a set maximum number of mines.

2. Attempting to add 1 to the text count in a cell using (cell.textContent += 1) resulted in going from 1 to 11. This was remedied by using textContent++

3. When checking the number of mines each cell touches, going cell by cell did not work. Cells that were on the next line, and therefore not touching a mine were getting counted. Attempting to solve the issue by searching row by row.

4. Cells with mines in them were being given a count. Fixed by running a loop after the count was done to remove text from any mine cells.

5. Using a for of loop to go row by row did not allow for checking above and below the current row. Changed to a standard for loop.

6. Ran into an issue where cell counts were not being reset to zero. Added a reset loop at the start of the new game function.

7. Clicking on an empty cell should show all connected empty cells and the immediately border numbered cells. Currently, only the empty cells show.

1. Checking tiles row by row is causing the game to reveal mines in lower levels. Attempting to check adjoining cells.
